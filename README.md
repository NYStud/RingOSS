I'm not affiliated with Ring. I just downloaded thE OSS .zip file off their website ([here](https://shop.ring.com/pages/oss) and [here](https://shop.ring.com/pages/oss-attribution-notice), which logically I'm assuming must contain changes), and then moving them here because the other way is not ideal.
